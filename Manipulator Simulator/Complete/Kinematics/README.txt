# curriculum_matlab built with Matlab R2018a
This floders contains the files for the practical activities of the Kinematics module.

The files necessary for each pratical activity are

    PA #1 : Applying Vectors, Rotation Matrices, Frames and Transformation Matrices
            --> No files Matlab for this lab

    PA #2 : Looking at Jaco's DH parameters
            --> Verification_DH_FK.m

    PA #3 : Angular and Cartesian Positioning
            --> fowardKinematicsJaco6DOFS_complete.m and Verification_DH_FK.m

    PA #4 : Velocitites and Accelerations
            --> No files Matlab for this lab

    PA #5 : Jacobian
            --> Jacobian_complete.m and Verification_Jacobian.m

    PA #6 : Inverse Kinematics of a 6 DOF robot manipulator
